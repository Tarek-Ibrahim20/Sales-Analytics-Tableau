This Tableau sales analytics project is a comprehensive exploration of sales data aimed at deriving actionable insights and facilitating informed decision-making. The project journey unfolds as follows:

### Data Preparation with Excel:
The project commenced by utilizing Excel for dataset cleaning, ensuring data integrity and quality before transitioning to Tableau for advanced analytics and visualization.
### Data Modeling and Integration:
Upon transitioning to Tableau, the focus shifted towards establishing a robust data model. Data types were verified, and tables including orders, returns, and managers were joined to provide a comprehensive view of the sales landscape.

### Calculated Fields and Data Analysis:
Essential calculated fields were developed to enhance data analysis efficiency, enabling a deeper understanding of the dataset. These fields played a crucial role in uncovering insights and trends within the sales data.
### Visualization Development:
Visual representations were crafted to effectively communicate descriptive facts present in the dataset. Efforts were made to capture and present key performance indicators (KPIs) such as profit, sales, backlog of uncomplicated orders, and more.
Revenue Forecasting and Business Insights:
The project delved into forecasting overall revenues for the upcoming week, aiming to anticipate future trends. Exploration of relationships and anomalies within the data, particularly focusing on negative profit and excessive discounts, provided valuable insights into business performance.
Interactive Dashboards and Storytelling:
Two Interactive Holistic Dashboards were created to summarize crucial KPIs within the dataset, offering a dynamic and immersive data exploration experience. Additionally, a Tableau story was crafted to provide context and narrative coherence to the analytical findings.
